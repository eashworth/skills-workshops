Course goal: "I can test anything"
Sub-goal: Understand how to test behaviour rather than state
Exercise (from behaviour_not_state.md):
Start writing a tic-tac-toe implementation, but only the first user stories:

I can see the board on the screen
I can put an X on the board
You might need more than one class for this,
but you don't need to create them all up front if you don't want to.

Remember, test behaviour, not state.
